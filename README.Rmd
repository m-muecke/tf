The goal of **`tidyfun`** is to provide accessible and well-documented software that **makes functional data analysis in `R` easy** -- specifically data wrangling and exploratory analysis. 
This package **`tf`** provides the infrastructure for **`tidyfun`**  with minimal dependencies -- specifically, no `tidyverse`-dependencies.  

`tf` includes definitions of the necessary new data types (`tf`) and associated methods. Vectors of class `tf` can be operated on using many standard functions (`+`, `mean`, etc.) as well as several new functions in `tf` (`tf_smooth`, `tf_where`). 

**Crucially**, vectors of class `tf` can be included in data frames containing other variables, enabling simple data manipulation. This approach is connected to the conceptual framework in functional data analysis which assumes that _complete functions_ are the unit of observation. With `tidyfun` and `tf`, full curves sit alongside numeric, factor, and other observations on the same subject. 

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("tidyfun/tf")
```

## Overview

**`tidyfun`** provides:

- new **data types** for representing functional data: **`tfd`** & **`tfb`**
- arithmetic **operators** and descriptive **statistics** for such data
- basic **graphics** functions for `tf` vectors

Please see the [`tidyfun` website](https://tidyfun.github.io/tidyfun) for the full documentation.

## What does it do?

#### New vector-like data types for functional data

**`tf`** provides [new `S3`-classes for functional data](https://tidyfun.github.io/tidyfun/reference/index.html#section-tf-sub-classes-constructors-converters), either as raw data (class `tfd` for *t*idy *f*unctional *d*ata) or in basis representation (class `tfb` for *t*idy *f*unctional *b*asis data). 

Such `tf`-objects can be subsetted or subassigned, computed on and summarized. 

Almost all

- operators like `==`, `+` or `*`
- math functions like `sum`, `log` or `abs` 
- and statistics functions like `mean` or `sd`  

are defined for **`tf`**'s data structures ([more](https://tidyfun.github.io/tidyfun/reference/index.html#section-arithmetic-logical-and-summary-functions)).

The `tf` objects are basically glorified lists, so they work well as columns in data frames. That makes it a lot easier to keep your other data and functional measurements together in one object for preprocessing, exploratory analysis and description. At the same time, these objects actually behave like vectors of *functions* to some extent, i.e., they can be evaluated on any point in their domain, they can be integrated or differentiated, etc.

[See here](https://tidyfun.github.io/tidyfun/articles/x01_tf_Vectors.html) for more information on the operations defined for `tf` vectors. 

#### Methods for converting existing data to `tf` and back

**`tf`** includes functions `tfd` and `tfb` for converting matrices, data frames, etc. to `tf` vectors and back. 
More data wrangling functionality in a `tidyverse`-inspired way is available from `tidyfun`. 

[See here](https://tidyfun.github.io/tidyfun/articles/x02_Conversion.html) for details on getting data into (and out of) the `tf` format.
